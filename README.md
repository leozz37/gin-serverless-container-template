## Building

By far, the easiest way to get everything running is with `docker-compose`. See the [docker-compose](#docker-compose) section. First, set up the environment variables for your project. You can use the `.env.example`:

```shell
$ source .env.example
```

### Binary

To build the binary, run the following:

```shell
$ go build -o ${APP_NAME}
```

To run the binary, run the following:

```shell
$ ./${APP_NAME}
```

Or simply:

```shell
$ go run main.go
```

### Makefile

To run the through the Makefile, run the following

```shell
$ source .env

$ make run
```

### Docker

Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine.

To build the Docker image, run the following:

```shell
$ docker build . -t ${APP_NAME}            
```

To run the Docker image, run:

```shell
$ docker run -p ${PORT}:${PORT} ${APP_NAME}
```

### docker-compose

To run the docker-compose:

```shell
$ docker-compose up
```
